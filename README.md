# Welcome to the Expense Analyzer Project

## Background and Inspiration
The motivation for this project is to allow a user to create report based on a collection of expenses. It is meant as an aid to users who want to manage their expenses using the 50%-30%-20% rule. 
The idea is to divide a person's take home pay into three categories, spending 50% on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings

## What the Program offers
The program will analyze the data provided and apply the rule mentioned above. Beyond that, the program inquires users if they wish to move money from one category to another to cover expenses if applicable. Beyond that, the script analyzes credit card debt and provides reccomendation on which to prioritize for payment by analyzing the approximate interest and credit utilization on that card.
